Shopping List Application
Description
The Shopping List Application is a simple web-based tool designed to help users manage their shopping lists.

Edit Items: Edit existing items in the shopping list.
Mark as Purchased: Mark items as purchased to keep track of what you have already bought.
Remove Items: Remove items from the shopping list.
Persistent Storage: The shopping list is stored in local storage, so it remains available even after the browser is closed.
